This list has some Chicago-centric references, but almost everything has an analogue in your city. For instance, if you're in New Zealand you can go on a _bush walk_, while we Midwesterners have to settle for a hike.

### This List Possible Thanks To A Million Folks

### Strategy
1. Poll the group in advance and allow them to raise concerns.
2. Give plenty of options.
3. Do daytime things so family folks can join.
4. Some options may not work if you have team members with accessibility needs, or particular concerns. That's _okay_.
5. Keep trying new things!
